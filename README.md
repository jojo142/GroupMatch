# GroupMatch Business Plan

## 1.0 Executive Summary

GroupMatch is a fresh take on dating, introducing the idea of double dating to help singles connect in a more fun and natural way. Instead of the typical one-on-one setup, GroupMatch focuses on group outings and shared experiences, making dating less intimidating and more enjoyable. By encouraging users to interact in a relaxed social setting, the app fosters real, meaningful connections while reducing the pressure often associated with modern dating. Built on the values of community, safety, innovation, and inclusivity, GroupMatch aims to redefine how people meet and build relationships in today’s world.

To achieve its goals, GroupMatch has laid out three clear objectives. The first is to attract a wide audience of singles aged 18 to 35 by launching in bustling urban areas with vibrant social scenes. Once established, the app plans to expand into suburban neighborhoods and college towns, reaching even more people who enjoy social, group-based interactions. The second objective is to keep users engaged by offering smart matchmaking tools, curated double-date ideas, and fun features that encourage repeat use. The third is to build a sustainable business model, blending a freemium subscription option with added revenue from in-app purchases and partnerships with local businesses to host exciting double-date events.

GroupMatch’s success depends on a few key factors. First, the app is designed to make dating feel easy, safe, and enjoyable. Features like verified profiles, video introductions, and compatibility-focused matching ensure users feel comfortable and confident while using the app. Strategic market expansion is also crucial, starting with major cities full of young professionals and later growing into smaller communities. Partnerships with local venues will play a big role, offering users memorable date experiences while creating additional revenue for the company. Lastly, GroupMatch’s unique focus on group dynamics and shared experiences sets it apart in the crowded dating app market, giving it a clear identity and strong appeal.

By combining its mission, goals, and smart strategies, GroupMatch is going to shake up the dating world. It offers a fun, fresh alternative for singles who want to connect in a more comfortable and exciting way.

This setup helps break the ice and creates a casual, fun atmosphere that makes it easier to connect.

## 3.0 Market Analysis

### 3.1 Target Market

The target market for the group-based dating platform comprises primarily young professionals aged 18 to 35. This demographic seeks alternative social interactions that go beyond traditional dating apps, favoring experiences that prioritize meaningful connections, safety, and transparency. The initial launch will focus on metropolitan areas such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco, cities known for their vibrant social scenes and diverse populations. These urban centers are home to large numbers of young professionals who are open to exploring innovative social experiences.

### 3.2 Industry Research

To better understand the needs and preferences of our audience, primary research methods such as surveys and interviews will be utilized. These will help gather insights into dating habits, comfort levels with group settings, and overall interest in attending curated group dating events. Additionally, a beta test will be conducted in a selected metropolitan city, providing a pilot group with the opportunity to experience the platform. Feedback collected from user reviews and post-event surveys will offer valuable qualitative data, helping to refine the service and improve user satisfaction.

Secondary research reveals broader market trends that align well with the platform's focus. Reports indicate a growing preference for social and experience-based dating platforms, such as Meetup, particularly among younger demographics. These users are increasingly drawn to services that offer safer and more transparent ways to connect.

Furthermore, industry data suggests that GroupMatch is entering a rapidly growing industry. The global online dating market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%, reaching 3.05 billion in revenue in 2024. As younger generations gravitate toward safer, experience-based platforms, the demand for meaningful connections continues to rise. With a market projected to reach $11.03 billion by 2030, we’re positioned to carve out a niche that aligns perfectly with these evolving trends, setting GroupMatch up for long-term success. Additionally, the total addressable market consists of $63.9M+ users and user penetration is 17.9% in 2024 and is expected to hit 19.0% by 2028.

Together, the findings from primary and secondary research underscore a significant opportunity for our platform as this industry is predicted to grow in both user penetration and revenue. By addressing the specific needs of young professionals and leveraging emerging market trends in experience-based dating, our service has the potential to carve out a distinct niche within the growing online dating market.

### 3.3 Competitor Market Share

The rising number of users of apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and others is further projected to contribute to the market growth. Tinder has significant popularity and growth. The average number of subscribers on Tinder increased to 10.4 million in 2020 from 7.9 million in 2018. Bumble users increased to 1,142.1 thousand in 2020 from 855.6 thousand in 2019. Therefore, the significant increase in the users of online dating platforms across the globe shows that this industry continues to grow and was accelerated by the pandemic.

Looking at the market share pie chart, we can see Tinder takes up about 32% of the market share, Bumble takes about 22%, and Hinge takes about 15%. All together, these three big players account for nearly three-quarters of the market, around 74%, reflecting the dominance of swipe-based and relationship-oriented apps. There are other smaller players that cater to specific user preferences but maintain a foothold in the market due to their niche focus. This data indicates that while a few major players dominate, there is still room for specialized apps like GroupMatch to carve out a niche by focusing on group dates and curated experiences.

### 3.4 Competitor Feature Comparison

Next, we will focus on our competitors' offerings and how we are planning to differentiate. Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge each cater to different dating experiences, but none focus on group interactions like GroupMatch. Tinder is known for quick swipes and individual matches based on proximity, offering basic safety features and limited one-on-one messaging. It monetizes through subscription tiers like Tinder Plus and Gold, starting at $24.99/month, with minimal customization options. Bumble empowers women by allowing them to make the first move, emphasizing user safety through photo verification and offering subscriptions starting at $19.99/month. While it includes conversation prompts, its social engagement remains focused on one-on-one connections. Hinge targets users seeking long-term relationships, using detailed prompts and preferences to foster meaningful interactions. It highlights profile verification for safety and offers Hinge Preferred plans starting at $19.99/month. While these apps excel in their niches, none prioritize group-based socializing, event planning, and affordable subscription pricing like GroupMatch.

### 3.5 Differentiation from Competitors/Value Proposition

GroupMatch sets itself apart from competitors by prioritizing group dating and shared experiences, creating a unique platform for low-pressure connections in social settings. Unlike Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, which focus primarily on individual matches, GroupMatch emphasizes group compatibility and curated activities, fostering meaningful interactions in a collaborative environment. Our platform tailors experiences with group profiles and activity preferences, allowing users to explore shared interests through carefully curated events and activities. Additionally, our freemium model offers accessibility with our premium plan starting at $15.99/month, providing many benefits and advanced features for users at a lower cost than our competition.
